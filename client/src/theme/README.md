# Theme Directory

This directory was empty. Theme configuration is currently inlined in `src/index.css`.

If you want to extract theme configuration to separate files, you can create:

- `theme.ts` - Theme configuration constants
- `theme-provider.tsx` - Theme provider component (if using context)
