HOW TO SEE YOUR SERVER LOGS
================================================================================

Your servers are running in SEPARATE PowerShell windows. Here's how to see them:

METHOD 1: Look for the Open Windows
------------------------------------
1. Look at your taskbar for multiple PowerShell windows
2. Each window has a title like:
   - "Agents Service - Port 8001"
   - "Backend Server - Port 8000"
   - "Frontend Server - Port 5173"
3. Click each window to see the logs

METHOD 2: Alt+Tab to Find Them
--------------------------------
1. Press Alt+Tab
2. Look for PowerShell windows with server output
3. Each one shows different logs

METHOD 3: Start Fresh with Visible Output
------------------------------------------
1. Close all existing PowerShell windows (or they'll show old logs)
2. Run this command in your current terminal:

   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass .\scripts\start-dev.ps1

3. Watch this terminal for all the logs!

METHOD 4: Check if Servers Are Running
----------------------------------------
Run this command to see if servers are running:

   netstat -ano | findstr "8000 8001 5173"

If you see "LISTENING" entries, your servers are running.


WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THE LOGS:
------------------------------
Backend Window (port 8000):
  - "[BUILD] Session abc123: Calling google_fetcher..."
  - "[BUILD] Session abc123: Agents service completed"
  - Any validation errors

Agents Window (port 8001):
  - "[Designer] Calling gpt-4o"
  - "[Mapper] Calling gpt-4o"
  - "[Generator] Calling gpt-4o"
  - "[QA] Calling gpt-4o"
  - Validation errors like "Validation error: 1 validation error for..."

Frontend Window (port 5173):
  - "Local: http://localhost:5173"
  - Vite compilation status

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If you can't see any logs:
1. The servers might not be running - check with netstat command above
2. The windows might be minimized - check Alt+Tab
3. Restart everything by running the start script again

If logs show validation errors:
- Look for the specific error message
- It will say what field is missing or what type is wrong
- Share that error message with me for help fixing it
