# Changes Summary - Stock Image API Migration

## 🎯 Objective Completed

Replaced hardcoded stock image URLs with **dynamic Unsplash API integration** for real-time, relevant stock image fetching.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Logic
- ❌ Deleted `CATEGORY_STOCK` dictionary (20+ hardcoded URL lists)
- ❌ Removed `pick_assets()` function
- ✅ Replaced with dynamic API calls

### 2. Added Unsplash API Integration
- ✅ `fetch_stock_images(query, count)` - Async function to fetch images from Unsplash
- ✅ `build_search_query(place_types, business_name)` - Maps business types to search terms
- ✅ Emergency fallback for when API is unavailable
- ✅ Rate limit handling (50 requests/hour on free tier)

### 3. Updated Both Services
- **Agents Service** (`agents/app/generator/generator_agent.py`)
- **Simple OpenAI Server** (`simple_openai_server/simple_agent.py`)

### 4. Made Methods Async
- Changed `_enhance_with_stock_images()` to async in both services
- Added `await` calls where needed
- Integrated with existing async workflows

### 5. Added Dependencies
- Added `httpx==0.25.2` to `simple_openai_server/requirements.txt`
- (Agents already had `httpx`)

### 6. Created Documentation
- **`UNSPLASH_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide for getting API key
- **`STOCK_IMAGE_API_MIGRATION.md`** - Technical migration details
- **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

## 📋 Setup Required

### 1. Get Unsplash API Key

Follow the guide in [`UNSPLASH_SETUP.md`](./UNSPLASH_SETUP.md):

1. Create account at [unsplash.com/join](https://unsplash.com/join)
2. Register as developer at [unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
3. Create new application
4. Copy Access Key

### 2. Add to Environment

Add to `.env` files:

```env
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key_here
```

**Locations:**
- `agents/.env`
- `simple_openai_server/.env`

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# For simple server
cd simple_openai_server
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For agents (if needed)
cd agents
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Simple Server

```bash
cd simple_openai_server
python run_example.py
```

**Look for:**
```
[*] Searching Unsplash for 'pizza restaurant interior' (count=3)
[OK] Found 3 images for 'pizza restaurant interior'
```

### Test Agents

```bash
cd agents
python test_build_no_mcp.py
```

**Look for:**
```
[Generator] Fetching stock images for query: 'pizza restaurant interior'
[Generator] Using 0 business + 3 stock images
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Flow

```
1. Check if business has ≥2 HTTPS images
   YES → Use business images
   NO  → Continue to step 2

2. Build search query
   "pizza_restaurant" → "pizza restaurant interior"
   "cafe" → "coffee shop cafe"
   etc.

3. Call Unsplash API
   - Search for query
   - Get 3 landscape images
   - Return high-res URLs (1600px)

4. Fallback if needed
   - API fails → Emergency fallback (2 generic images)
   - No API key → Emergency fallback
   - No results → Emergency fallback
```

### Emergency Fallback

If Unsplash API is unavailable:
- Uses 2 hardcoded high-quality generic business images
- No crashes or failures
- Logs a warning

---

## 📊 Benefits

### Before (Hardcoded)
- ❌ Same images for every pizza restaurant
- ❌ Limited to 20 pre-defined categories
- ❌ Manual curation required
- ❌ Static, unchanging visuals

### After (Dynamic API)
- ✅ Unique, relevant images for each business
- ✅ Covers ALL business types automatically
- ✅ No manual curation needed
- ✅ Fresh, varied visuals
- ✅ Search-optimized queries

---

## 🚦 API Limits

### Free Tier (Current)
- **50 requests/hour**
- No approval needed
- Perfect for development/testing

### Production Tier (If needed)
- **5,000 requests/hour**
- Requires application review
- Apply at unsplash.com/oauth/applications

---

## 🎯 Next Steps for User

1. **Get API Key** → Follow `UNSPLASH_SETUP.md`
2. **Add to `.env`** → `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_key`
3. **Install deps** → `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Test** → Run `run_example.py` or `test_build_no_mcp.py`
5. **Verify** → Check logs for "Searching Unsplash..."
6. **Monitor** → Watch API usage (50/hour limit)

---

## 🔒 Fallback Safety

Even without an API key, the system works:
- Uses emergency fallback images
- No crashes or failures
- Landing pages still generated successfully

**You can choose:**
- Set API key → Get dynamic, relevant images
- No API key → Use emergency fallback (still works!)
